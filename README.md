# icinga

The Icinga module allows you to easily manage an [Icinga](https://icinga.org/) server.

Icinga itself is a fork of [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) which is a tool for monitoring hosts and services on a network.

# Work In Progress

This module is still *very* early. I use it every day in production, but it doesn't really do anything other than manage things in /etc/icinga/objects on ubuntu right now.
Most of it was written in one marathon coding session one night at a coffee shop in Glendale with a deadline looming the following day, so I was shooting for minimum viable product.

# Puppet Compatibility

I develop against puppet 3 because that's what I use. I don't make any guarantees or promises that this module will work or will continue to work on older versions of puppet.
I'm willing to entertain pull requests which improve compatibility with older versions of puppet, however, so please feel free to send them over!
